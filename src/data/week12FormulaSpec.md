# Week 12 Formula Spec (Working Notes)

This file is the single source of truth for formula inputs shared by the user for `Week12` (Constructing The Goal).

Status: **authoritative for Week12 only** (do not default to older module constants when they conflict).

## Batch 1 - Tax Assumptions and Brackets (2026)

## Workbook Cell Map (A1 References)

This section maps values to workbook-style addresses so formulas like
`'Week 7 B - Fed Ordinary 2026'!$B$3:$B$9` can be implemented directly.

Implementation note:

- Preserve row order exactly as shared. Some formulas may depend on ordered bracket rows.

- Existing `src/data/stateTaxData.js` is close but not guaranteed identical to this Week12 table.
- Week12 should use the user-shared state rows/ranges as the source of truth.

### Validation Checkpoints (Spot Checks)

Use these checkpoints to quickly confirm the workbook map is still aligned:

#### `Week 7 B - Assumptions`

- `B1` = `Week 7 B - Assumptions`
- `C2` = `3%`
- `C3` = `7%`
- `C4` = `$24,500`
- `C5` = `$7,500`
- `C11` = `$16,100`
- `C13` = `59.5`

#### `Week 7 B - Fed Ordinary 2026`

- `B2:D2` = `Lower | Upper | Rate`
- `B3:C3:D3` = `$0 | $12,400 | 10%`
- `B9:C9:D9` = `$640,600 | $1,000,000,000,000 | 37%`

#### `Week 7 B - Fed LTCG 2026`

- `B2:D2` = `Lower | Upper | Rate`
- `B3:C3:D3` = `$0 | $49,450 | 0%`
- `B5:C5:D5` = `$545,500 | $1,000,000,000,000 | 20%`

#### `Week 7 B - State Tax Brackets`

- Header: `B2:E2` = `State | Lower | Upper | Rate`
- First data row: `B3:E3` = `AK | $0 | $1,000,000,000,000 | 0.00%`
- Next rows: `B4:E4` = `AL | $0 | $500 | 2.00%`; `B5:E5` = `AL | $500 | $3,000 | 4.00%`
- Last data row: `B163:E163` = `WY | $0 | $1,000,000,000,000 | 0.00%`

## Batch 2 - `Week 7 B - Projection Engine` (Inferred Pre-Formula Map)

Source: user-shared screenshot + tabular export for Year `0..59` (ages `22..81`).

### Sheet Layout (A1)

Assumed from screenshot row/column labels:

- Sheet name: `Week 7 B - Projection Engine`
- Title: `B1`
- Header row: `B2:R2`
- Data rows: `3:62` (Year 0 in row 3 through Year 59 in row 62)

Column map:

- `B`: Year #
- `C`: Age
- `D`: Salary (nominal)
- `E`: 401k Limit
- `F`: IRA Limit
- `G`: 401k Contrib
- `H`: IRA Contrib
- `I`: Broker Contrib
- `J`: Employer Match
- `K`: Trad Balance
- `L`: Roth Balance
- `M`: Broker Balance
- `N`: Broker Basis (cum contrib)
- `O`: RMD
- `P`: YearsToRetire (helper)
- `Q`: `43` (helper constant shown in header area)
- `R`: Trad Balance (pre-RMD)

### Inferred Logic (from values)

#### 1) Time axis

- `Year #` increments by 1 from 0 to 59.
- `Age` starts at 22 and increments with year.

#### 2) Salary and limits

- `Salary (nominal)` grows by `4%` YoY in sample (`3% CPI + 1% extra raise` from user inputs).
- `401k Limit` grows by CPI (`3%`) from 24,500.
- `IRA Limit` grows by CPI (`3%`) from 7,500.

#### 3) Contributions

- `401k Contrib` = `% of 401k limit` (example: 50%).
- `IRA Contrib` = `% of IRA limit` (example: 100%).
- `Broker Contrib` starts at user input (2,000) and grows by nominal broker contribution rate
  (observed `5%` = `3% CPI + 2% user broker growth`).
- `Employer Match` = salary * employer match % (example: 3%).
- Contributions (G/H/I/J) are nonzero through age 65 row, then become 0 at age 66+.

#### 4) Balance evolution (core engine)

Observed formulas are consistent with annual recurrence:

- `Trad pre-RMD` (`R_t`) = `K_(t-1) * (1 + nominalReturn) + G_t + J_t`
- `RMD` (`O_t`) = `IF(Age_t >= RMDStartAge, R_t / divisor(age_t), 0)`
- `Trad Balance` (`K_t`) = `R_t - O_t`

- `Roth Balance` (`L_t`) = `L_(t-1) * (1 + nominalReturn) + H_t`
- `Broker Balance` (`M_t`) = `M_(t-1) * (1 + nominalReturn) + I_t`
- `Broker Basis` (`N_t`) = `N_(t-1) + I_t`

Where nominal return from assumptions is `7%`.

#### 5) RMD divisor behavior

RMD begins at age 73 in sample and matches IRS Uniform Lifetime style divisors:

- 73: 26.5
- 74: 25.5
- 75: 24.6
- 76: 23.7
- 77: 22.9
- 78: 22.0
- 79: 21.1
- 80: 20.2
- 81: 19.4

### Numeric Spot Checks (consistency)

- Year 1 Trad: `17,298 = 0*1.07 + 12,618 + 4,680`
- Year 2 Trad: `36,372 ≈ 17,298*1.07 + 12,996 + 4,867`
- Year 44 (age 66) Trad: `7,149,052 ≈ 6,681,357*1.07` (contribs zero)
- Year 51 (age 73) pre-RMD: `11,479,815.65`; RMD `433,200.59`; post-RMD Trad `11,046,615`
- Broker basis freezes after retirement contributions stop: `300,286` persists.

### Open items to confirm when formulas are shared

- Exact absolute references used in formulas (e.g. assumption cells and named ranges).
- Whether broker balance later applies withdrawals/taxes in this sheet or downstream sheets only.

### Confirmed formula received after initial inference

- Years-to-retire helper formula:
  - `=MAX(0,'Week 7 - The Goal'!$G$12 - 'Week 7 - The Goal'!$G$10)`
  - Interpretation: `RetirementAge - CurrentAge`, floored at zero.
  - This confirms `Week 7 - The Goal`:
    - Current age cell: `G10`
    - Retirement age cell: `G12`

## Batch 5 - `Week 7 B - Tax Engine` (Known Formulas Captured)

Source: user screenshot + user-provided long formulas in text.

### Sheet Intent

`Week 7 B - Tax Engine` computes:

- working-year tax baseline (federal + state + payroll),
- retirement-year tax on withdrawals (ordinary + LTCG + state),
- final total taxes used by `Week 7 B - Results!C21` / `C31` pathway.

### Confirmed formulas (verbatim from user)

#### Payroll tax (SS + Medicare + addl Medicare, year 0)

### Dependency notes confirmed by these formulas

- Working state in Tax Engine is referenced from `C5` and currently maps to `'Week 7 - The Goal'!$G$20`.
- Retirement state in Tax Engine is referenced from `C6`.
- Year-to-retirement / indexing uses `C3` and inflation `C4`.
- State bracket formulas intentionally reference broad ranges `B3:E5001` (not tightly bounded to row 163).
